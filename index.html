      I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms
      and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information
      systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been
      supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a
      MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
      Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
      Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur
      Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of
      Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of
      Arts and Sciences.<br /><br />

        In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences
        in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an
        introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of
        ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.

              support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented
              with optional advanced sections.
